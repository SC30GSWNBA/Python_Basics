Basic Python Programming Questions for Beginners

Hello All,

I created this respository for myself as a revision exercise. I hope it helps others who have some/limited/zero knowledge of Basic Python. Feel free to have a look around. 
All the notebooks uploaded could be executed in Colab/Jupyter. Comments/Suggestions are most welcome.

P.S: This is not a tutorial and contains only questions on Python Coding that could be helpful for cracking online tests.

Thanks,
